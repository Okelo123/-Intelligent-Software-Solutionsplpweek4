#🔍 Overview
This project explores the integration of AI into software engineering workflows. It demonstrates:

How AI tools like GitHub Copilot improve code efficiency

How automated testing with Selenium boosts test coverage

How machine learning models can predict issue priorities

How ethical frameworks like IBM AIF360 help mitigate bias in models

✅ Features
🧠 AI-Generated and Manual Code Comparison

🧪 Automated Login Testing (Valid/Invalid Scenarios)

📊 Predictive Model for Issue Prioritization

⚖️ Fairness and Bias Mitigation Analysis

📷 Test Execution Screenshots and Metrics

📄 PDF/Notebook Outputs for Academic or Industry Review

🧠 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis
AI-Driven Code Generation – Pros, time savings, and limitations

Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning – Use in automated bug detection

Bias Mitigation in Personalization – Importance of fairness

AIOps Case Study – Examples of predictive CI/CD and self-healing deployments

🚀 Part 2: Practical Implementation
AI Code Completion
Manual vs. Copilot-style function to sort a list of dictionaries

200-word analysis comparing performance and clarity

AI-Powered Test Automation
Selenium script automates login page testing for valid and invalid users

Screenshots captured and included

150-word analysis on AI-based test automation

Predictive Analytics with Random Forest
Uses Breast Cancer Dataset from scikit-learn

Encodes priority as “high” or “low”

Trains and evaluates a Random Forest model using accuracy and F1-score

🧭 Part 3: Ethical Reflection
Identifies dataset bias risks (e.g., demographic imbalance)

Recommends IBM AI Fairness 360 to mitigate such bias

Discusses responsible deployment of AI in decision-making contexts
